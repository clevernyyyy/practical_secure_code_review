Roles do not seem to be implemented yet, so everything seems to use a "userOwns" check: [/**](https://github.com/Attendize/Attendize/blob/9289acbab1583898fd85aeee66c7b613d8971deb/app/Attendize/Utils.php#L81-L87)

## Brainstorming / Risks
* Here is what the feature or product is supposed to do... what might go wrong?
* Okay - based on the tech stack, I've realized that the:
  * ORM - Does SQLi in _this_ way
  * Template language introduces XSS in _this_ way
- [min 8 characters in passwords](https://github.com/Attendize/Attendize/blob/develop/app/Http/Controllers/UserSignupController.php#L57)
## Checklist of things to review
### Risks
- [ ] Look for instances of `{!! $thing !!}` in the template/views (there is tons of this)
- [ ] Look for OS commands
### Authentication
- [ ] Login page give error messages, check for enumeration
- [ ] Signup page allows for freeform passwords, does it implement proper password complexity?
- [ ] [Custom Captcha](https://github.com/Attendize/Attendize/blob/develop/app/Services/Captcha/Factory.php)
- [ ] [UserLoginController](https://github.com/Attendize/Attendize/blob/develop/app/Http/Controllers/UserLoginController.php)
### Authorization
- [X] CSRF disabled anywhere?
- [X] No auth
### Auditing/Logging
- [X] There is essentially no logging here (besides console logging)
### Injection
- [ ] ORM `where` function allows for string concatenation, search for all instances
- [ ] Search for `system` `shell_exec` `exec`
> You can escape `CONCAT_WS` with a single ' (attendee first name)
### Cryptography
- [X] Using Laravel's Hash facade which provides secure Bcrypt and Argon2 hashing for user passwords
### Configuration
- [ ] Look for any "Laravel Gotchas"
- [ ] Hardcoded values
- [ ]
